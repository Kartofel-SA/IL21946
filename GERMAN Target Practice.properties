Description GERMAN Target practiceAll types but not all versions available.. \n\nThis will load your machine hard! \n\n\nHistorical markings and aircraft, Years not considered, on both sides. For when you practice full real.\n\n All AI are TARGET DROWNES They have no ammo!! \nI can host on my 256/3000 cable connection and let 1 or two Onliners join in with me. But I usually fly it alone with airstart to get into practice as fast as I can.  I made it COOP  for two reasons. One so incase there is a difference in AI FM for Online over Single player, two so I could let someone fly with me and practice aswell. Then Land when out of ammo or fuel.\n\nIf unlimited ammo is on always shoot short burst to get your aim right for limited practice. You don't want a bad habit of holding the trigger down till you hit or destroy target. \n\n\n Good practice and  good luck! \n\nT_O_A_D\n
