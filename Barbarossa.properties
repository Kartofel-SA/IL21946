Today we will sneak attack on our former communist ally, beginning operation Barbarossa, the largest military operation of all times. Our spies tells us that the russians dont expect us at all, so lets take advantage while their soldiers are sleeping and their planes on the ground.\n\nII./JG51 Stukas and the He111 will attack the ennemy airfield, destroying the maximum number of grounded aircraft. They will be escorted by Bf109 fighter/bombers from II./JG 51\n\n14.(Jabo)/JG 5 Stukas will attack the fortress, the railway station and nearby ground forces, preparing the terrain for our troops who are marching on the city. They will be escorted by Bf109's from I./JG 5\n\nGood luck and come back alive!\n\n\n</ARMY>\n\n<ARMY RED>\nJune 22, 1941\n\nBrest-Litovsk Fortress, Russian Border\n\nIts 6h00 in the morning and you wake up at the sound of the siren alarm. This must be another exercise since we signed a peace treaty with our german neighbor. Unless these rumors about a sneak attack have been true?\n\nYou feel like a punch in the stomach when your commanding officer screams in your sleepy ears: SCRAMBLE! THE GERMANS ARE ATTACKING!\n\nI-16 Polikarpov fighters will provide air cover for a trio of I-153 ground attack planes who will help to stop the german army.\n\nIL-2's and LaGG-3's (our most recent airplanes) will come assist us from another airfield .\n\n\nGood luck and come back alive!\n\n</ARMY>\n--------------------\n\n
